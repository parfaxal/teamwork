    <h1>Economical Impacts</h1>
    <h3>E-commerce</h3>
    <p>Computers becoming so widely used has led to the rise of e-commerce giants such as Amazon overtaking traditional retailers.
        Although this has had negative effects on local businesses, it has also made shopping extremely convenient for the average
        consumer, especially those who struggle to go shopping in person due to location, age, or disability.
