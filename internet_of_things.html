    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of real-world objects embedded with sensors and software that are able to transmit and receive data over the Internet.</p>
    <p>The IoT includes objects like smart fridges, self-driving cars, smart fitness watches, smart home security systems and many more.</p>
    <p>These devices are constantly processing the data the receive from their sensors, and are programmed to transmit any data they deem to be important over the Internet, either to its users or a server for further processing.</p>
    <p>For example, smart home security systems are always processing the images taken by the camera, using machine learning to detect any suspicious activity in its view. Because it is connected to the Internet, the security system can automatically send a notification to the user (the home owner) alerting them of the suspicious activity.</p>
    <p>This allows for the home owner to respond much quicker than if the video was simply stored in secondary storage to be reviewed later, thereby greatly improving the security of user's home.</p>
